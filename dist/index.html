      The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and
      stylish platform that elevates your screen to a more comfortable
      viewing height. Placing your monitor at eye level has the potential
      to improve your posture and make you more comfortable while at work,
      helping you stay focused on the task at hand.

      Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of design creates extra desk
      space below your computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored under the stand.
